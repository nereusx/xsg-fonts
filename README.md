# xsg-fonts

Target: Clear and easy to read bitmap unicode fonts. No art, just clear as possible and a bit condensed.

## Charsets:

* Latin1
* Latin2
* Greek
* Cyrilic (I hope, fix and send)
* Drawing box
* Several more characters mostly for icons and polybar

## SIL Open Font License (OFL)

## Notes:

* xsg-fixed names:

	xsg-fixedYYX:
	YY = height in pixels, X  = width in pixels

	(Standard VGA Fonts = 9x16)
	
	The R in the end of the file means "Regular" (non-bold)
